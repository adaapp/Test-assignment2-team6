# Assignment2-Team6 - Currency Converter

## The link to our website - https://adaapp.github.io/Test-assignment2-team6/

## Website objectives
The objective of this website is to create a currency convert that allows the user to enter a number in the textbox and it should output the conversion. The user will have a drop down box that allows them to choose between the different currencies 
## Approach to testing
the initial smoke test was completed to test if the framework we used for testing was working correctly, this was just an expect where 1 is to be 1.
For testing the functions we used the jest framework. The format of these tests look as so:
  describe(''), ()=>{
    test(''), ()=>{
      expect();
    };
  };

By using expect we can pass a test if the expected matches the actual. There will be tests for different edge cases to ensure our website doesnt break.
## Coding standards

Variable naming - use of camel casing throughout the js
Simple code - aiming to write simple code so that it is understandable if the website was to be maintained
readable - making the format of the code readable(correct indentations, spacing, capitalisation)

## Definition Of Done
The definition of done is when all conditions, or acceptance criteria, that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by a user.
In this case :
  when all functions work correctly by converting between one currency to another
  when functions have been tested fully
  Fully functioning UI 


## Lighthouse Accessibility

This shows the performance, accessibility and best practices of the website. It is used for the developer to understand where the website may be lacking and highlight sections of the website that need improvement.


Our accessibility report was not 100% accoriding to LightHouse, the tool we used to assess our webpage. In order for us to get 100% we needed to make the colours contrast with each other. We went ahead and changed some of the colours in order for the users to be able to see the text better.

As you can see above we went for more suitable colours based on the feedback we got.
