## Website objectives
The objective of this website is to create a currency convert that allows the user to enter a number in the textbox and it should output the conversion. The user will have a drop down box that allows them to choose between the different currencies 
## Approach to testing
the initial smoke test was completed to test if the framework we used for testing was working correctly, this was just an expect where 1 is to be 1.

## Coding standards

Variable naming - use of camel casing throughout the js
Simple code - aiming to write simple code so that it is understandable if the website was to be maintained
readable - making the format of the code readable(correct indentations, spacing)

## Definition Of Done
The definition of done is when all conditions, or acceptance criteria, that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by a user.
In this case :
  when all functions work correctly by converting between one currency to another
  when functions have been tested fully
  Fully functioning UI
